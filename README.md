# IMS

--> I Khushi Singh have created an Inventory Management System.
--> It have several attributes:
    1 - Product Name
    2 - Product Category
    3 - Manufacturing Date
    4 - Expiry Date
    5 - Price
    6 - Weight
    7 - Quantity
--> Here I have used loops so that if the user enters the wrong syntax of phone no. (like string) he will be told about the mistake and will be asked to re-enter it upto the       time he enters the correct number.
--> Also, I have used the loops and nested if for:
    1 - If the user enter the quantity of any product greater than it is present in inventory, than he will be asked that either he want the product with different quantity or         wanna buy some another product.
    2 - User will also be asked if he/she have any referal code if he have than futher it will be checked if valid referal code or not also if it is valid for his order.
--> And after the order completion our inventory will be updated for the quantity.
